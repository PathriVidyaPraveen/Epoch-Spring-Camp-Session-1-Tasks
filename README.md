This is a github repository for the Tasks given in the Epoch Session 1 of Spring Camp on March 28 , 2025. The problem statements and their corresponding codes have been provided in the repository.

Task - 1:
Implement a 4-way kaleidoscope effect using NumPy and Matplotlib.
1. Grayscale Image:
● Load or generate a grayscale image using NumPy.
● Apply a 4-way kaleidoscope transformation by reflecting and rotating the quadrants appropriately
● Use Matplotlib to visualize the transformed image.
2. RGB Image:
● Extend the implementation to work with RGB images.
● Ensure that each color channel undergoes the same transformation as the grayscale version.
● Display the resulting kaleidoscope effect using Matplotlib.


1. Kaleidoscope Program

Objective: Create a Python program to generate a kaleidoscope effect using loops and graphics.
Submission: Submit your code via GitHub or as a Google Colab notebook. Include a screenshot/GIF of the output and a brief explanation of your code.
